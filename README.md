# I am Here to Talk

You are going to talk to people you have previously talked on WhatsApp (or to yourself) again.

## How does it work

### Prepare the file

Export a WhatsApp conversation from your device. You must select an option 'without media' for this to work. 

```
Give examples
```
### Upload the file

Then, you will simply upload the '.txt' file for the next step.

## Information on Personal Data 

This app does not store your data â€“ in fact, it doesn't have a database. If you feel incredulous, you can check the codebase here. Enough said; now, initiate a chat.

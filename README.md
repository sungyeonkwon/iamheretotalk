# I am Here to Talk

## What to do with this app

Use it to talk to people you have previously talked on WhatsApp (or to yourself) again.

## How does it work

1. Export a WhatsApp conversation from your device
    *  Click on a Profile / Group info
    * Click on 'Export Chat' below on the menu
    * Choose 'Without Media'
    * Send / download the file
2. Prepare & Upload the file
    * Unzip the downloaded file
    * Upload the '.txt' file to the app

## Information on Personal Data 

This app does not store your data â€“ it doesn't have a database. All chat data is temporarily stored on the front end and when you refresh the page, it will be gone.

## Testing

Use file 'test.txt' to see how it works.

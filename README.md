# I am Here to Talk

You are going to talk to people you have previously talked on WhatsApp (or to yourself) again.

## How does it work

Export a WhatsApp conversation from your device. 
1. Export a WhatsApp conversation from your device. 
  1. Click on a Profile / Group info
  2. Click on 'Export Chat' below on the menu
  3. Choose 'Without Media'
  4. Send / download the file
2. Prepare & Upload the file
  1. Unzip the downloaded file
  2. Upload the '.txt' file to the app

## Information on Personal Data 

This app does not store your data â€“ it doesn't have a database. All the chat data is temporarily stored on the front end. If you refresh the page, your uploaded chat data will be all gone.

## Testing

Use file 'test.txt' to see how it works.

[17/01/2018, 00:03:53] John: That doesn‚Äôt sound like a very good trade-off!
[17/01/2018, 08:49:28] Sara: This is better than yesterday!
[17/01/2018, 08:50:02] Sara: SEE YOU SOON AND PLAY SOON
[17/01/2018, 10:14:34] John: OH MY GOD WHY DID YOU DO THAT

[17/01/2018, 13:38:50] Sara: YOU ARE EXTREMELY FUNNY
[17/01/2018, 13:39:25] John: Because I observe you!
[17/01/2018, 13:39:36] Sara: Because my dad confirmed he can come to London too with my mum!

[17/01/2018, 13:40:11] John: Because people change!
[17/01/2018, 13:40:15] John: Because they shovel snow and it is a lot harder than they remembered.
[17/01/2018, 13:40:21] John: I feel much much better today, feeling actually okay and realised how great it is to feel okay in comparison to feeling not okay
[17/01/2018, 13:41:32] John: I am realising having an intern does not necessarily reduce my workload because I have to explain everything and even then I have to re-work on it, it‚Äôs double the amount of work
[17/01/2018, 13:42:17] John: There were so many more exciting questions to be asked, but you have shown yourself to not be ready
[17/01/2018, 13:42:27] Sara: Ha. There was a study a few years ago where marathon runners were forced to walk about 20 minutes at intervals during their marathon, and over half of them finished faster than when they had run all of it, so that does work for a lot of people.
[17/01/2018, 13:42:51] Sara: SFO were supposed to contact people today but the civil service are always behind schedule so will probably be tomorrow.
[17/01/2018, 13:45:03] John: My housemate just said that her need to have hot water to wash her hair at 5am is more important than my need to not get woken up in the middle of the night.
[17/01/2018, 13:45:23] Sara: I think that kind of society could totally stifle growth.
[17/01/2018, 13:45:40] John: I think you look more like your dad!
[17/01/2018, 13:45:46] John: I think we must use more pesticides
[17/01/2018, 13:46:02] Sara: I think I‚Äôve been to Ronda, not sure though
[17/01/2018, 13:53:40] John: I think I'm under constant stress now.

[17/01/2018, 20:40:53] Sara: I want to know if I am being too harsh or nasty in here
[17/01/2018, 20:42:08] Sara: I feel so tired it‚Äôs like having a brain injury.
[17/01/2018, 20:42:18] Sara: I feel like today's condition was just super good for some reason
[17/01/2018, 20:42:29] John: I feel validated now.
[17/01/2018, 20:42:40] Sara: I feel a bit sorry for her because she wanted it but she just has too much self respect.

[17/01/2018, 20:44:23] Sara: I‚Äôm not sure I understood your question?
[17/01/2018, 20:44:37] John: Like rose water in the icing?

[17/01/2018, 20:44:50] John: Did you actually dance to the song?
